# shop App

## Shop inventory management system that any shop owner can use to manage all shop operations [buy and sells].

All you have to do is to download the app and adding all your products then use the app to add orders or entries from supplier and it will control the shop database .

Additional features :
- user can import and export the database to share it with other mobile or for backup .
- application can generate reports and make csv files for what you want.

next features :
- support QR code for products.
- save data globally

In this project I used Provider as state management and SQFLITE as local database and applied MVVM architecture .
